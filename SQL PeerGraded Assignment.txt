Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table =10000
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562(business_id)
iii. Category = 2643(businees_id)
iv. Attribute =1115(business_id)
v. Review = 10000(id)
vi. Checkin = 493(business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000(id)
viii. Tip = 537(user_id)
ix. User = 10000(id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. Place with higher rating (4.0) opens late and closes early. I chose Las Vegas city and food category.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes. The one with higher star rating has more review count.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
 
Both are present in different location of las vegas city. The one with more star rating is present in eastern Ave where as the one with less rating is present in Tropicana Ave.


SQL code used for analysis:

 select b.name
,b.stars
,h.hours
,b.review_count
,b.postal_code
,b.address
from (business b inner join hours h on b.id=h.business_id) inner join category on b.id=category.business_id
where b.city= "Las Vegas" and category.category="Food"
group by b.stars

+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+-----------------------------+
| name                        | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code | address                     |
+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+-----------------------------+
| Walgreens                   |   2.5 | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |            6 | 89121       | 3808 E Tropicana Ave        |
| Sweet Ruby Jane Confections |   4.0 | Saturday|10:00-19:00 |           30 | 89123       | 8975 S Eastern Ave, Ste 3-B |
+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+-----------------------------+

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The business that are open have more checkins than those that are closed, which is obvious.
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The business that are open have more review count that those that are closed.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
Select b.name
,sum(c.count)
,sum(b.review_count)
,b.is_open
from business b
inner join checkin c
where b.id=c.business_id
group by is_open

+-------------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+
| name                                | sum(c.count) | sum(b.review_count) | is_open |
+-------------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+
| Stella's Pizza & Italian Restaurant |           15 |                 192 |       0 |
| Davitino's Restaurant               |          823 |                6743 |       1 |
+-------------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+---------+

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	I chose to study which is the most rated restaurant in Yelp.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

	To carry out the analysis, I need the star ratings, name of the restaurant, reviews and where it is located (in case, I go there someday). After getting all the data, I order them on the basis of stars in decreasing order so that I get the most rated restaurants in the yelp dataset. 
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
	
	I found out that, one of the most rated restaurant "Big City Grill" with star rating of 5 located in Charlotte has only 4 reviews. I was shocked that, such popular restaurant has just 4 reviews. I guess, it is rated by the employees of the restaurant only. Another most rated restaurant is "Green Corner Restaurant" with 267 reviews. It is present in Mesa with star rating of 5.
